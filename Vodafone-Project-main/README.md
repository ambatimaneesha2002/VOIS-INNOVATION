# Vodafone-Project
VODAFONE CAMP PROJECT
TEAM NO. 89
The Main motto of this project is to concentrate on the Sign Board detection system.
The dataset to this is collected form the GSTRB- German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark data set.
The German Traffic Sign Benchmark is a multi-class, single-image classification challenge held at the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) 2011. We cordially invite researchers from relevant fields to participate: 
The competition is designed to allow for participation without special domain knowledge. Our benchmark has the following properties:
•	Single-image, multi-class classification problem
•	More than 40 classes
•	More than 50,000 images in total
•	Large, lifelike database

A StreamLit Application is also done to test the images by loading it to them.
The accuracy is much more than 98% for every image you feed. 

Moving forward on adding novelty 
1.	Busy Lane Detection
a.	Which is done by using inbuilt haar-cascade XML files
2.	Location using IP-address
a.	Using already available geo-Py module and using ip address
3.	Weather at that location by extracting the data from the API 

One more additional installation in this is the drowsiness detection of the driver
Which is done using the already prepared model by me.

The github repo for this is as follows:

The same template is used for further processing and addition of other novel models.

And the reference for Image classification on multi class dataset is https://pyimagesearch.com/2017/12/11/image-classification-with-keras-and-deep-learning/

And then the next segment is addition of Path-hole detection system
The data set is collected from Kaggle 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/virenbr11/pothole-and-plain-rode-images
Here VGGNet is made use to build the model. The following source is considered for the tensorflow model
